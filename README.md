# Postwork Planning Overview

The period of time immediately after completing the coursework can be one full of mixed emotions and competing impulses.  On the one hand you may feel great and accomplished for having worked hard throughout the course, you learned some real skills and you can actually build things and that's really cool! On the other hand you may be really stressed about what lies ahead because after basically knowing exactly what you would be doing every day week after week for the duration of the course there is all of a sudden so much uncertainty.

There are a few main things we want to communicate to help you be successful in the postwork period and ultimately achieve your goal of landing that first job writing code.  The first is...     

##### **Don't Stop Working**
*all of the hard work you put in to the coursework should give you a pretty good model of what your postwork life should look like.*

So you know that you need to put in the work. The question is what do you work on?  The next, but by no means second, most-important-thing is...      

##### **Write Code Everyday**
*this means your hands are on the keyboard writing code and running code every single day.  Reading a book on Algorithms for 6 hours a day or trying to get through Cracking the Coding Interview from cover to cover is not writing and running code.*

One feeling shared by many postwork students is that there can seem like so many different things to work on that they almost don't know where to begin.  
+ First there will be old projects worked on in class.  There will be parts of that code that you *know* could use some refactoring or features planned but never quite implemented.
+ Another thing you may want to do is build a new project. That group project you did may have some flaws but you learned a ton since then and want to apply that knowledge to something fresh that you can make really well crafted.  
+ There will also be lots of Technical Interview preparation you want to do, going through an algorithms course online, practice problems from sites like codewars or books like Cracking the Coding Interview.
+ Then there are so many new (or new to you) technologies, what are Node and MongoDB anyway? What if the the company you really want to work at uses AngularJS in their stack and you learned React?  
+ And on top of all of this there is all the other things you want to do to make yourself the best candidate.  Your linkedin may need another edit or you want to attend some meetups and continue networking, etc.

How do you navigate this?  Help yourself out by giving yourself some **structure**.  Rather than "Tomorrow I will work on some stuff all day", *make a schedule and stick to it*. Here is what an example schedule might look like:

TODO: Complete this example schedule   

| Time | Activity |  
| ---- | ----- |  
|9:00 - 10:30 | Solve Algorithm Questions  
|10:30 - 12:30| Review old topics you find difficult.  
|1:30 - 3:30  | Work on your assigned track material.  
|3:30 - 5:30  | Career prep, network, apply to jobs.  
|5:30 - 6:00  | Research, read and stay up to date on new technologies.
